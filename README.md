# compiler_test_monitor

*Please use branch "base_project", it is the most updated*


Lazy instructions for the example and/or template:
1. Download repo
2. Cd into the example folder
3. Run script: ../run_tests.sh
3.5. wait for the folder structure to be created.
4. Add mini java test files to the subfolders of test within the newly constructed compiler_test_monitor_files folder.
5. Run the script again.


The script will handle compilation.
There's a silly dependency to the makefile:
There needs to be two rules named compiler and interpreter.

See the Template project to get a better idea of what is required...
